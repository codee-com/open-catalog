# Open Catalog of Code Guidelines for Correctness, Modernization, Security, Portability, and Optimization

## About

This Open Catalog is a collaborative effort to consolidate expert knowledge on
code guidelines for the correctness, modernization, security, portability, and
optimization of code written in C, C++, and Fortran programming languages. The
Catalog consists of a comprehensive set of checks (rules) that describe specific
issues in the source code and provide guidance on corrective actions, along with
extensive documentation, example codes and references to additional reading
resources.

## Benchmarks

The Open Catalog includes
[a suite of microbenchmarks](https://github.com/codee-com/open-catalog/tree/main/Benchmark/)
designed to demonstrate:

- No performance degradation when implementing the correctness, modernization,
  and security recommendations.
- Potential performance enhancements achievable through the optimization
  recommendations.
